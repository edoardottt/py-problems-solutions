I wrote these files while I was attending *Algorithm Design* course held by Prof. Monti Angelo in Sapienza University.
The course concerned about:

  - Graph Theory
  - Greedy algorithms
  - Divide et Impera
  - Dynamic Programming
  - BackTracking algorithms
  - Depth and Breadth first search
  - Dijkstra's algorithm
  - Tarjan's algorithm
  - Directed acyclic graph
  - Particular graphs and problems:
       - Knapsack
       - Longest Path in DAG
       - CPM
       - Sudoku
       - ...
