Some implementations to various problems with Python.

[![Python 3.6](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.6-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/)

I wrote these files while I was attending 'Algorithm Design' held by Prof. Monti in Sapienza University.
The course concerned about:

       Graph Theory
       Greedy algorithms
       Divide et Impera
       Dynamic Programming
       BackTracking algorithms
       Depth and Breadth first search
       Dijkstra's algorithm
       Tarjan's algorithm
       Directed acyclic graph
       Particular graphs and problems:
           - Knapsack
           - Longest Path in DAG
           - CPM
           - Sudoku
