I wrote these files while I was attending 'Algorithm Design' course held by Prof. Monti in Sapienza University.
The course concerned about:

       Graph Theory
       Greedy algorithms
       Divide et Impera
       Dynamic Programming
       BackTracking algorithms
       Depth and Breadth first search
       Dijkstra's algorithm
       Tarjan's algorithm
       Directed acyclic graph
       Particular graphs and problems:
           - Knapsack
           - Longest Path in DAG
           - CPM
           - Sudoku
